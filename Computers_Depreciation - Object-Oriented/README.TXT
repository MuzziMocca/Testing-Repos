This is a program to help with computer upgrading or disposal.

After few assignments similar to this program, I came to understand from my 
lectures and lecturers that software developers are problem solvers, and as a result, 
I worked on a solution that would help the university staff, especially IT staff 
to locate computers based on their compatible and value from the library or computer lab.
And if they know the computer number, they can find from that the value and compabilities 
of that specific computer.
